A Snippet from my React/Redux CMS for uploading images to the server.

Obviously it won't work for real unless you're connected to a backend.

For demo purposes I have replaced the function which does the xhr.send. It emulates an upload and updates the redux state 
accordingly so the upload component displays valid data.

Can be run by yarn start, or the build can be run as http://localhost//react_upload/build/index.html
